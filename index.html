		Yes, Kamila and I got married.
		Because of the Coronavirus we had to aggressively slim down the guest list.
		I am sorry if you are seeing this and are learning of our wedding plans for
		the first time or were not invited.
		We had a great trip, are sad that we returned during a pandemic, and look
		forward to seeing everyone when we are able.

		Notes on the code:
			With a few exceptions I wrote all the code myself.
			Do you like how I used almost no JavaScript?
		Exceptions (things I didn't write myself):
		- The external link icon was modified from Wikipedia's External Link icon
			https://en.wikipedia.org/w/skins/Vector/resources/skins.vector.styles/images/external-link-ltr-icon.svg
		- The links Instagram, Facebook and Pinterest were taken from Hillary's website and modified slightly
		- The favicon was generated using https://favicon.io/.
			Their Terms Of Use was broken as of July 18, 2020 at 20:44.
		- I used many tips from Jonathan Harrell's article Advanced CSS Only Form Styling
			https://www.jonathan-harrell.com/blog/advanced-css-only-form-styling/
			In particular, I used his ✓ and ✗ mostly unmodified.
		- RSVP submissions are collected using Formspree
			https://github.com/formspree/formspree

		Thank you Hillary for the fantastic photos.
