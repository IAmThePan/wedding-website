## This is a website for my wedding

Yes, Kamila and I got married.
Because of the Coronavirus we had to aggressively slim down the guest list.
I am sorry if you are seeing this and are learning of our wedding plans for
the first time or were not invited.
We had a great trip, are sad that we returned during a pandemic, and look
forward to seeing everyone when we are able.
